# DetideNet

In construction: code for the "Filtering Internal tides from wide-swath altimeter data using Convolutional Neural Networks" paper, accepted for publication in IEEE IGARSS 2020 conference.

This repository contains an example code of training DetideNet, please contact me for the Summer/Winter data (2,4 Go each)

I am working on a extended version of the IGARSS paper, new architectures and optimal versions of the code will be shared soon. In the meanwhile you can watch some animations I made:
